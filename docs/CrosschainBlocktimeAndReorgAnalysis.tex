	\section{Introduction}
	This document provides an analysis of block times, chain reorganizations, and timelocks across Cardano, Ethereum, and BNB Chain.
	
	\section{Block Times}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Cardano: Approximately 20 seconds
		\item Ethereum: 12-14 seconds
		\item BNB Chain: Approximately 3 seconds
	\end{itemize}
	
	\section{Chain Reorganizations}
	The frequency and depth of chain reorganizations are affected by block times:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item BNB Chain: More frequent but shallow reorgs due to faster block times
		\item Ethereum: Balanced between frequency and depth of potential reorgs
		\item Cardano: Less frequent but potentially deeper reorgs due to slower block times
	\end{itemize}
	
	\section{Timelocks and Cross-Chain Operations}
	A 1-minute timelock translates differently across chains:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Cardano: Approximately 3 blocks
		\item Ethereum: 4-5 blocks
		\item BNB Chain: About 20 blocks
	\end{itemize}
	
	This disparity can lead to synchronization challenges, different levels of finality, and increased complexity in cross-chain operations.

	\section{Conclusion}
	The varying block times across Cardano, Ethereum, and BNB Chain present significant challenges for cross-chain operations, particularly in terms of synchronization, finality, and timelock management. Careful consideration of these factors is crucial when designing cross-chain protocols and operations.
