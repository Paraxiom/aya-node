Event Categorization:

System Events:

These events concern the internal operations of your oracle system.
Examples: validator set changes, parameter updates, governance decisions.
Typically handled within your blockchain without external validation.


Cross-Chain Transaction Events:

Events related to transactions or state changes on other blockchains.
Require external validation and often involve light clients.
Critical for cross-chain interoperability.


External World Events:

Real-world data that needs to be brought on-chain.
Examples: price feeds, weather data, sports results.
Often require multiple independent sources for validation.



Event Sourcing Methods:

Push Model (Reporter-driven):

Events are submitted to the priority queue by external reporters.
Advantages: Real-time updates, can handle unpredictable events.
Challenges: Need mechanisms to prevent spam and ensure reporter reliability.


Pull Model (Offchain Worker):

The system's offchain workers actively fetch data from external sources.
Advantages: More control over data sourcing, can implement regular checks.
Challenges: Might miss real-time updates, requires careful scheduling.


Extrinsic Submissions:

Events submitted directly through blockchain transactions.
Advantages: On-chain record of submission, can be tied to identity.
Challenges: Higher cost for submitters, potential for blockchain congestion.



Considerations and Recommendations:

Hybrid Approach:

Use a combination of push and pull models.
Critical, time-sensitive data can be pushed by trusted reporters.
Regular, predictable data can be pulled by offchain workers.


Event Processing Pipeline:

Implement a unified processing pipeline that can handle events from all sources.
Include stages for initial validation, categorization, and routing to appropriate handlers.


Source-specific Validation:

Develop validation rules specific to each event category and source type.
For pushed events, implement a reputation system for reporters.
For pulled data, use multiple sources and compare results.


Priority and Urgency:

Use the priority queue to manage event processing order.
Implement an urgency classification system within each category.


Cross-Chain Verification:

For cross-chain events, use light clients to verify the state of external blockchains.
Implement a waiting period for finality on the source chain before processing.


Governance and Configuration:

Allow for dynamic configuration of which events are handled by which method.
Implement governance mechanisms to add or remove event types and sources.


Scalability Considerations:

Design the system to handle different volumes for different event categories.
Implement rate limiting and load balancing mechanisms.


Auditability:

Maintain clear logs of event sources, processing steps, and outcomes.
This is crucial for both system integrity and potential dispute resolution.



Implementation Strategy:

Start by clearly defining your event categories and their characteristics.
Design a flexible event structure that can accommodate all categories.
Implement the core processing pipeline that can handle events from all sources.
Gradually add specialized handlers for each event category.
Implement and fine-tune the push and pull mechanisms.
Develop the cross-chain verification system using light clients.
Build the governance layer to allow for system adjustments.
