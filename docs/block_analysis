\section{Block Times}
Cardano: Approximately 20 seconds

Ethereum: 12-14 seconds

BNB Chain: Approximately 3 seconds

\section{Chain Reorganizations}
The frequency and depth of chain reorganizations are affected by block times:

BNB Chain: More frequent but shallow reorgs due to faster block times

Ethereum: Balanced between frequency and depth of potential reorgs

Cardano: Less frequent but potentially deeper reorgs due to slower block times

\section{Timelocks and Cross-Chain Operations}
A 1-minute timelock translates differently across chains:

Cardano: Approximately 3 blocks

Ethereum: 4-5 blocks

BNB Chain: About 20 blocks

This disparity can lead to synchronization challenges, different levels of finality, and increased complexity in cross-chain operations.

\section{Conclusion}
The varying block times across Cardano, Ethereum, and BNB Chain present significant challenges for cross-chain operations, particularly in terms of synchronization, finality, and timelock management. Careful consideration of these factors is crucial when designing cross-chain protocols and operations.
